## Techologies Used
- #### HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):

HTML is responsible for structuring the web page and defining its content using tags and elements.
It creates the layout and hierarchy of the app's elements, such as headings, paragraphs, forms, images, and links.
HTML ensures that the content is semantically structured and accessible to both users and search engines.
- #### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

CSS is used to add visual styles, layout, and design to the HTML elements.
It controls the presentation of the web page, including colors, fonts, spacing, backgrounds, and other visual properties.
CSS ensures consistent styling across the app, enhancing its appearance and providing a visually pleasing user interface.
JavaScript:

- #### JavaScript:
Adds interactivity, dynamic functionality, and data manipulation to the web app.
It handles user interactions, such as form submissions, button clicks, and navigation.
JavaScript enables DOM manipulation, allowing for the modification of HTML elements, their attributes, and content in response to user actions.
It communicates with servers, APIs, or local data files (such as db.json) to fetch or save data, update the UI, and provide real-time interactivity.

- #### Db.json (Data file):

db.json is a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file that serves as a simple database or data source for the web app.
It stores structured data, such as recipes, in a JSON format with properties and values.
The JavaScript code in the app can read, modify, and update the data in db.json using fetch requests or other appropriate techniques.
This allows the app to retrieve recipe data, add new recipes, update existing recipes, and perform other CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data.
